    <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
      Linux is an operating system created by Linus Torvals. Linux initially created the Linux kernel as a project and decided to make it open source, so that everyone could make contributions. Nowadays, it is one of the most active open source projects with almost a million contributions by thousands of users from around the world. Distributions have been created from the initial concept of Linux for different uses, such as Ubuntu (for home users) or Fedora (more advanced distro).

      Bootstrap
    </h2>
    <p>
      This website was created using Bootstrap, a framework for creating websites that is open source. Many other professional web developers use Bootstrap to power their web application design because it makes websites easier to produce, following a CSS and JS template created by Bootstrap, directly from their open source community. Bootstrap users can take advantage of this custom CSS code written for them by using it in their website content, through the use of ids and classes embedded into HTML content.
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Other projects</h2>
    <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
      There are many other projects that have been deployed as open source for various different reasons, either for the community to help them in developing their application or solution, or simply because they want to share their software to make it available to everyone around the world without having to pay for it. This is one of the most important advantages of using open source software. You don't need to pay for it and you can customize it as you wish and make modifications to suit your needs.
